AppsCMS is an open source Applications Management System Library for PHP (AppsCMS) with a focus on web applications and
processing frameworks, written in the traditional Object Orientated Program (OOP) style.
Recommend PHP 7.2 or higher.

I often found myself needing a secure and simple AppsCMS to run web applications that present dynamic data,
control machinery and external processes. The AppsCMS is unique as the AppsCMS is contained within cms/ directory
boundaries, providing web support for applications while leaving the applications to grow independently.
The KIS ideal is the mantra.

The AppsCMS has many built in aids including programming aids, log viewing, debugging, examples and setup searches.
Making the AppsCMS easy to learn and implement.

Contributions and feedback are welcome (see web site).
